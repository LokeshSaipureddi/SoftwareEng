# Airline seat selection, Borading pass issuance and aircraft boarding
## Abstract
Nowadays flights have become a popular mode of transportation. With the increase in population, there's more demand for an easier mode of transportation. This puts a higher load on the airline companies, justifying the need for digitizing the underlying processes in airline management ranging from ticket booking to  inventory management. </br>
         Unlike previous times where agents used to be the mediators between the airlines and users, this project can direct users into the online platform where they can book tickets without any external means and the Airlines can customize the way they offer bookings, packages and interactions with their customers. Other manual process like Boarding pass issuance is also digitalized through the application, which ensures the manual work is reduced, making the operations less time consuming and tiresome for the customers as well as the staff. </br>
         In addition to this, this project can be helpful for the airlines by introducing their company to the market in various places. </br>
